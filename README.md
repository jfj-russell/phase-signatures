# Phase-Sensitive Signatures in HHG

This is the repository for the webpage [https://jfj-russell.github.io/phase-signatures/](https://jfj-russell.github.io/phase-signatures/)

It hosts animated figures and the report from my undergraduate project,  
"Quantum Tunnelling Without a Barrier: Phase-Sensitive Signatures in HHG."
